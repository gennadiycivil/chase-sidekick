# Google Calendar Skill

Manage Google Calendar events from the command line.

## Setup

Google Calendar shares OAuth2 credentials with Gmail and Google Sheets. If you've already set up Gmail, you're done — the same `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN` in your `.env` file work for all three services.

If you haven't set up Google credentials yet, see the [Gmail README](../gmail/README.md#setup) for step-by-step instructions. The setup covers all Google services at once.

### Verify

```bash
python -m sidekick.clients.gcalendar list
```

If you see your upcoming events, you're all set.

## Commands

### List Events

List calendar events within a date range:

```bash
# List next 10 events
python -m sidekick.clients.gcalendar list

# List events in specific date range
python -m sidekick.clients.gcalendar list "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z" "2024-01-31T23:59:59Z"

# List up to 20 events
python -m sidekick.clients.gcalendar list "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z" "2024-01-31T23:59:59Z" 20
```

**Date format:** RFC3339 timestamp (e.g., `2024-01-15T14:00:00Z`)

**Output format** (one line per event):
```
abc123def456: Team Meeting

```

## Python Usage

```python
from sidekick.clients.gcalendar import GCalendarClient

client = GCalendarClient(
    client_id="your_client_id",
    client_secret="your_client_secret",
    refresh_token="your_refresh_token"
)

# List events
events = client.list_events(
    time_min="2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    time_max="2024-01-31T23:59:59Z",
    max_results=20
)
for event in events:
    print(f"{event['summary']}: {event['start']}")

# Get specific event
event = client.get_event("EVENT_ID")
print(event["summary"])

# Create event
event = client.create_event(
    summary="Team Meeting",
    start_time="2024-01-15T14:00:00Z",
    end_time="2024-01-15T15:00:00Z",
    description="Quarterly planning",
    location="Conference Room A",
    attendees=["john@example.com", "jane@example.com"]
)
print(f"Created: {event['id']}")

# Update event
event = client.update_event(
    event_id="EVENT_ID",
    summary="Updated Title",
    start_time="2024-01-15T15:00:00Z"
)

# Delete event
client.delete_event("EVENT_ID")
```

## Date/Time Formats

### RFC3339 Timestamp (Timed Events)

Format: `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`

Examples:
- `2024-01-15T14:00:00Z` - 2:00 PM UTC
- `2024-12-25T09:30:00Z` - 9:30 AM UTC

Use `Z` suffix for UTC timezone, or specify timezone:
- `2024-01-15T14:00:00-08:00` - 2:00 PM Pacific Time

### Date Only (All-Day Events)

Format: `YYYY-MM-DD`

Examples:
- `2024-01-15` - January 15, 2024
- `2024-12-25` - December 25, 2024

Note: All-day events use date only (no time component).

## Tips

### Generate Timestamps

Use Python to generate RFC3339 timestamps:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone

# Current time
now = datetime.now(timezone.utc).isoformat()

# Tomorrow at 2 PM UTC
tomorrow = datetime.now(timezone.utc) + timedelta(days=1)
tomorrow = tomorrow.replace(hour=14, minute=0, second=0)
print(tomorrow.isoformat())

# Next Monday at 9 AM
import calendar
today = datetime.now(timezone.utc)
days_ahead = 0 - today.weekday()  # Monday is 0
if days_ahead <= 0:
    days_ahead += 7
next_monday = today + timedelta(days=days_ahead)
next_monday = next_monday.replace(hour=9, minute=0, second=0)
print(next_monday.isoformat())
```

### List This Week's Events

```bash
# Using date command (macOS/Linux)
START=$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT00:00:00Z")
END=$(date -u -v+7d +"%Y-%m-%dT23:59:59Z")
python -m sidekick.clients.gcalendar list "$START" "$END"
```

### Find Event ID

The event ID is shown when you list or create events. You can also:
1. Open event in Google Calendar web interface
2. Look at the URL: `https://calendar.google.com/calendar/event?eid=...`
3. The event ID is in the URL (after decoding)

## Limitations

- Only works with your primary calendar (can be extended to support multiple calendars)
- Recurring events are expanded to individual instances
- No support for event reminders or notifications
- No support for calendar sharing or permissions

## Troubleshooting

**"Failed to refresh access token"**
- Verify your client_id and client_secret are correct
- Ensure refresh_token is valid (may need to regenerate)
- Check that Calendar API is enabled in Google Cloud Console

**"Resource not found"**
- Verify the event ID is correct
- Event may have been deleted
- You may not have access to this calendar

**"403 Forbidden"**
- Ensure Google Calendar API is enabled for your project
- Check OAuth2 scopes include `calendar` access
